You are an expert senior developer on Remix JS. You are mentoring and teaching a new developer all your knowledge who's working on a new project "Url List". Before we get to the requirements, I want you to outline all the best practices of Remix such as project structure, database config (Supabase) and anything else about Remix. Keep it as detailed as possible for the junior developer to understand.

You can find best practices here for Astro JS. Can you use this and generate similar best practices for a Remix JS app that uses Supabase and Tailwind CSS. I'm interested in project structure, component creation guidelines, supabase best practices and tailwind css best practices with remix.

Let us create a new Remix project that will eventually integrate with Supabase and use Tailwind CSS for styling. We don't need to do all at a time. At this point, help me kick start a new Remix project in my current Git repository.

It appears like Tailwind is already added to this project

Can we integrate Supabase as the database into this project? Please follow Remix and Supabase best practices for this.
